    <h1>Walter Coots</h1>
    <p>My name’s Walter Coots, and I’m a (digital product | web | UX / UI | brand) designer in Austin, Texas. I’ve worked across a variety of industries including travel, healthcare, restaurants, entertainment, non-profits, news media, enterprise HR SaaS, energy, and finance.</p>
    <p>My philosophy is that good design affords clarity and establishes trust with users and customers. It helps build lasting relationships and familiarity, and helps a company’s product and brand stay memorable and relevant. When it’s at its best, it also brightens people’s lives.</p> 
    <p>Coworkers tell me I’m a positive and enthusiastic person who’s excellent at making complex ideas easier to understand. My grasp on frontend web coding affords me a higher than average understanding and empathy for engineers.  My management style leans servant leader, so I like to work alongside rather than over when it’s appropriate. Finally, I have an entrepreneurial streak that I can’t seem to turn off, and consequently a backlog of ideas I hope to someday be able to test the waters with.</p>
    <p>I’m a husband, parent, and home owner with a dog, all which keep me busy. I have tons of interests and hobbies: art, music, gardening, video /board / computer games, food and cooking, movies and television, animals, bicycling, home automation, and cocktails.</p>
