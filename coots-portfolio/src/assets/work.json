Brokers who are doing well for themselves have little incentive to change things, large firms even less so, and tenants are at the mercy of these gatekeepers’ well-established processes. Unilease was created by a commercial real estate broker in central Texas to streamline the way he did business, making it easier for both brokers and tenants. I was brought in to help establish a design system, improve the existing user experience, and expand the toolset Unilease offered with the intent of it becoming a product available to all brokers and brokerages.",

Using low fidelity wireframes, I created a modular content system to outline the different blocks of content we’d show, and when. For example, if a user had taken the same test six times and their latest results were normal, we wouldn’t show the same content as a brand new user who had abnormal results. This was a page from a document intended to get buy-in from stakeholders on what these blocks were, what order we’d show them, and in what phase we’d roll them out."

To make matters worse, one of our frontend engineers was colorblind, and it was really difficult for him to notice the differences. Additionally the entire company was wanting to become more ADA compliant, and we really didn’t have any internal guidelines on how that would translate to our work. I followed Lyft’s lead and used their <a href=“http://colorbox.io/“ target=“_blank”>color tool</a> to create a systematic color scheme. Black text was compliant on the 6 inner rings, and white text was compliant on the 6 outer rings. We didn’t use more than a handful of the colors, but it gave us room to grow if we needed. It was much easier to tell the devs to use “Blue 4” instead of “The same one we use for button colors”. Plus since all the colors were variables in the code, it paved the way to more smoothly roll out future branding."
