I was the design lead on this project."

But with a definition this broad, there was an added layer of complexity to find out what our internal stakeholders believed this project should solve. "

					"copy":"The PM and myself conducted interviews and surveys with both internal stakeholders as well as customers. After creating some opportunity solution trees and better identifying key problem areas, we worked together to highlight both what the “re-architecture” project would encompass along with what it wouldn’t. We didn’t want to change the design so much that what was working was eliminated, but we did want to rename and move things into places that were more self-evident."

					"copy":"Clarity of Data was more around clarity around quant data, how it was calculated, and affording better transparency into WorkStep’s algorithms. Reorganization and Renaming were the lenses I was primarily looking at the project through, since this was what I was familiar with and good at. The granularity of the ability management meant that a single customer may want entire pages, sections, or even just functionality on a page turned off for some of their HR team, but turned on for others, so the designs needed to still make as much sense as possible in those cases. One way this manifested was showing tabs on a page even if there were no sibling tabs, because the tab added context to users who may not have access to the sibling functionality and would aid customer support in helping users navigate."

WorkStep’s primary surveys were based on employee tenure. Other survey types were offered, but they were ancillary. As time went on, we discovered users still wanted these other types of surveys, and to be competitive we needed to offer them. The results data from the various surveys was reported on in largely the same way, so the biggest question was whether users would want to access results in a single area filtered to the data they wanted (e.g. “All Survey Results” but filtered to a specific survey or set of surveys), or specific areas for each survey to see those results (e.g. “Exit Surveys” with a results area.) We wound up going with a blended approach. Actual quantitative survey results resided within that survey’s area while the open text comments were in their own area, aggregated but able to be filtered."

The UI had to communicate clearly who would receive the message without revealing specific recipients, which required some creative approaches to visualization and confirmation screens."

Originally created to be an upsell, not many people were biting, so we wound up including it as part of the overall WorkStep package, and it has since seen a much larger adoption with a lot of people using it for a variety of purposes. We've heard stories of warehouse managers sending critical updates about facility closures during winter storms, and HR teams using it to provide guidance during unexpected operational changes. It's the kind of invisible utility that quietly does its job – which in product design, is often the highest praise."

As the product gained larger companies, the use cases for seeing different kinds of quant data expanded, and it was difficult to accommodate these in a one-size-fits-all design. My private goal with Reports was to pave the way for eliminating the Insights section altogether (which we eventually did) but more immediately we were putting the user in control of how they viewed their company’s data."

It wound up being a series of forms for users to choose their data point, and outside of ordering the cards, offered very little in the way of visual customization."

When someone rated the relationship with their manager a 1 or 2 out of 5, we'd show them an open text field asking for more details, but we'd typically get frustratingly brief responses like “bad boss” or “doesn't listen” Not exactly the actionable insights a human resources person is looking for."

					"type":"paragraph",
					"copy":"Our solution leveraged LLMs to analyze these sparse initial responses and generate a more specific follow-up question tailored to what the employee had shared. So instead of leaving it at “bad boss,” we might ask, “You mentioned your boss is bad. Is it related to communication style, availability, or something else?” This gave the employee a more concrete direction while still leaving room for their unique perspective."

"

				{
					"type":"paragraph",

Employers started getting feedback they could actually use to make targeted improvements, and employees felt more heard because they were able to express their concerns more precisely. It was a win-win that showed how thoughtful application of AI can enhance human communication rather than replace it."

For starters, HR teams and managers were overwhelmed by the volume of employee feedback they needed to respond to, leading to delays or templated replies that made employees feel ignored. But for some there was also “blank page syndrome”. However we didn't want to just automate responses entirely – that would defeat the purpose of building human connections. "

We explored possibilities that tried to help users write in different tones, but ultimately WorkStep is in the business of HR software, we’re not trying to replace Grammarly. Eventually we realized that at least for the first version of this feature, addressing that blank page syndrome would solve the majority of people’s difficulties."

What was most satisfying was seeing how it helped less experienced managers learn better communication patterns over time – they'd start by heavily editing the AI drafts, but eventually internalized those patterns in their own communication.

For starters, landlords didn’t have any incentive to change the way they did business, and brokers didn’t want to make themselves obsolete. Brokers relied heavily on their personal and professional connections, and a large part of their job was being the purveyors of this closely guarded information of which sometimes they only gained street cred and favors for.

We were all happy with the end result, but I think we could have gotten there faster and with fewer headaches if we’d all been on the same team."
