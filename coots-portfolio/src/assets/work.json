					"description": "The canvas devours intention before the brush even grazes its surface. What is a line but the memory of movement, an echo of an unseen gesture? I place color where color demands to be, not as a choice but as a reconciliation. The weight of an unspoken hue lingers in the air, vibrating between presence and absence. This is not creation but discovery, peeling back the skin of the ordinary to reveal the marrow of meaning beneath. But what if the meaning resists? What if the act of looking collapses it entirely? No matter—the act remains, indifferent to understanding."
				},
				{
					"description": "A shape dissolves into another, neither willing to remain distinct. Shadows press forward while light recedes, a reversal of the expected order. I try to capture the moment between breath and exhale, but the paper laughs at my arrogance. It does not record—it translates, misinterprets, improvises. I call it failure, but only to disguise my admiration. There is a violence in articulation, in forcing the unformed into structure, but also a tenderness in allowing it to remain incomplete. It is the silence between notes that defines the melody, the omission that allows the presence to take shape."

				{
					"pullquote": "It is not merely paint on canvas but a raw, unfiltered confrontation with the act of seeing itself—an unraveling of form, a negotiation with absence, a whispered rebellion against the notion of completion.",

				{
					"description": "I step back, but the work steps forward. It questions me in a language I do not speak, a dialect of smudges and fractures, of raw edges and accidental precision. What is left unfinished carries the weight of infinity, while what is complete is already decaying. I could call it done, but to do so would be a lie, a betrayal of the process. The work is never finished—only abandoned, only surrendered to time. It will wait here, watching, patient in its incompleteness, knowing that the moment I turn away, it will continue without me.",

				{
					"description": "To commission a piece is not to purchase an object but to summon something from the ether, to coax meaning from the unseen and give it a body. My work does not simply fill a space; it alters it, bends the air around it, teaches the walls to whisper. Each stroke is a dialogue between intention and accident, a record of something that can never be replicated, only witnessed. You are not paying for pigment on a surface—you are investing in a fracture in the ordinary, a disruption of the expected. The price is not for what you receive, but for what it continues to become long after I have set it free."

The software helps leaders identify ways they can improve working conditions for employees, thus leading to higher engagement and happiness in the workforce, which in turn leads to reduced turnover, and increases other important factors like productivity and safety.\r\nSince many of these employees aren’t desk workers and often have corporate emails, web-based surveys are sent out to workers’ personal contact info via text and email. Results are anonymous unless workers elect to reveal their contact info on a question-by-question basis, and the aggregated results are summarized and analyzed within the WorkStep app.\r\nAs is the case in a typical Series B startup, I wore a lot of hats and had my hands in a lot of areas in the product. I’ll take you through some highlights that I think were pretty fun and interesting.",

I was the design lead on this project."

Using low fidelity wireframes, I created a modular content system to outline the different blocks of content we’d show, and when. For example, if a user had taken the same test six times and their latest results were normal, we wouldn’t show the same content as a brand new user who had abnormal results. This was a page from a document intended to get buy-in from stakeholders on what these blocks were, what order we’d show them, and in what phase we’d roll them out."

To make matters worse, one of our frontend engineers was colorblind, and it was really difficult for him to notice the differences. Additionally the entire company was wanting to become more ADA compliant, and we really didn’t have any internal guidelines on how that would translate to our work. I followed Lyft’s lead and used their <a href=“http://colorbox.io/“ target=“_blank”>color tool</a> to create a systematic color scheme. Black text was compliant on the 6 inner rings, and white text was compliant on the 6 outer rings. We didn’t use more than a handful of the colors, but it gave us room to grow if we needed. It was much easier to tell the devs to use “Blue 4” instead of “The same one we use for button colors”. Plus since all the colors were variables in the code, it paved the way to more smoothly roll out future branding."
